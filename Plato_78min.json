The lie is that some people have gold in their souls, making them natural rulers, while others have silver or bronze, making them suited for other roles.\n\nThis turning point is significant because it challenges traditional notions of honesty and morality.

He suggests that every individual has a unique role to play in society, and that they should strive to fulfill this role to the best of their ability.\n\nPlato also explores the concept of the soul in the Republic. He suggests that the soul has three parts: reason, spirit, and desire. These three parts of the soul are reflected in the three classes of society: the rulers, the auxiliaries, and the producers.

Socrates skillfully exposes the flaws in Thrasymachus' argument through his use of logic and reason, which can be seen as a subtle form of satire.

He presents a scenario in which a person who has borrowed a weapon from a friend goes mad and tries to harm him, and the friend is forced to defend himself by killing the madman. Plato then asks whether this act of self-defense is just, and the interlocutors are forced to admit that it is.
