       " 'output': \"?\\n\\nDavid Copperfield is a novel that explores the themes of identity, family, and social class. The story is about a young boy named David, who grows up in poverty and faces many challenges throughout his life. One of the major themes of the book is the search for identity, as David struggles to find his place in the world and understand who he truly is. The novel also delves into the complexities of family relationships, as David experiences both the love and the betrayal of those closest to him. Another key theme in the novel is the impact of social class on people's lives, as David moves between different social circles and observes the prejudices and injustices that exist within each. Overall, David Copperfield is a rich and complex novel that explores some of the most fundamental aspects of human experience.\"}"
